# What is this?
This repo hosts an hourly updated list of image MD5 hashes scraped from
4channel's /vt/ board in 4chan X's image MD5 filter format, for the purpose 
of building a comprehensive filter of images of the vtuber Amelia Watson.

PRs which make the list more comprehensive are accepted, however, as commits
are automated hourly it's impossible for your PR's filter.txt to sync up with
the upstream -- as a conquence, place the image MD5 hashes you would like to
add in a seperate file `pr.txt` so they can be merged into `filter.txt` manually.
